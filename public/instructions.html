        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the world of -Insert game name here-! I have worked fairly hard on getting this to work as my first completed game. Below are special instructions that will improve your experienceand understanding of the game...</p>
        <p>The object of the game is to eliminate the blocks on the screen. Each level will be similar to the last, but the difficulty will increase as you go. The speed of the ball increases with every level and tehre is a special surprise at the end if you manage to make your way there! Good luck!</p>

        <h2>Controls</h2>
        <p>Use the arrow keys to move the paddle to either side of the screen. (You may also control it with your mouse, though that eliminates a particular feature of the game)</p>
        <p>The ball will bounce off the paddle and reflect back at the bricks in the direction you are moving the paddle (this does not work with the mouse movement)</p>

        <p>Music will play at the start of the game when you move the paddle: Press "P" to pause the music.</p>

        <p>At the end, you can add your score to the <a href="#">High Scores</a> list and compete with other players for the top spot!</p>

        <h3>Can you make it to the end?</h3>
